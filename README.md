# Emotiv Academy

Welcome to the Emotiv Academy code repository! Here you’ll find innovative projects and educational resources that unlock the power of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) using EMOTIV technology.

Our mission is to empower learners, educators, and makers to explore BCI applications through hands-on coding projects, tutorials, and open-source tools.

## Projects

This repository currently contains the following showcased BCI projects:

- **[RoboMaster_BCI](./RoboMaster_BCI)**  
  Control a DJI RoboMaster robot in real-time using mental commands detected by an EMOTIV headset.
